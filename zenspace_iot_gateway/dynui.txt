Dynamic UI overview/usage:

Every SDK application needs a main calling point, the SDK dynamic UI has a file called installer.py.
This file creates what is called a route map.  The route map creates a list of endpoints that are
called when a visitor connects to a website.  The example below demonstrates a client connecting to
a local router and pointing to the "hello" endpoint.  The router's http server reads this and sends
the word "Hello" back to the client's computer:

[ client computer ]                      [ router http server ]
https://192.168.0.1/hello       ->       <serve up page for hello endpoint>
                                <-       Hello
Hello

In the example SDK application, we setup two route maps, one route map is for '/(.*)' which is 
terminology for 'match anything sent after the IP/DNS address'.  It doesn't point at a directory
because it is only supposed to read from the SDK root directory.  This rule would catch any of these
requests and redirect the requests to the main index.tpl.html file:

https://192.168.0.1/
https://192.168.0.1/hello
https://192.168.0.1/anything

The SDK application also has a route map for '/resources/(.*)' which points to the 'resources/'
directory.  This is so our HTML code can load CSS and image resources out of the SDK to display to
clients.  The SDK application builds a route map list which contains tuples:

[('/(.*)', ''), ('/resources/(.*)', 'resources/')]

these are only two, but more can be added.  The route map is added to a message which tells the 
router's http server to start the application as a hotspotServer, which the installer.py file
sends to the router via our config store's client put command.

When the application is run, in hotspotServer mode, a unauthenticated client will connect to the
router and try to load a web page.  The router intercepts the request, and makes a call to the
new SDK's route map.  This will push the SDK's index.tpl.html file (as index.html) to the client,
if resources need to be loaded, resources are pulled in from the SDK's resources directory and
everything is displayed to the user.  The user must click the ACCEPT button in order for their IP
to be added to the list of accepted clients.
